Create beautiful mesh gradients at https://gradii.fun.

## Why Gradii?

I use mesh gradients as wallpapers and most of these gradients are locked behind paywalls or not free to use. So I built Gradii - a simple tool that could generate cool gradients for myself and others who love minimal, beautiful wallpapers. What started as a personal project turned into something I wanted to share with everyone who appreciates good design.

## What can Gradii do?

- Create stunning mesh gradients
- Add text overlays with various fonts and styles
- Add image overlays
- Use it as your wallpaper or as a marketing asset the possibilities are wide
- Export in multiple resolutions and aspect ratios

## Development

```bash
cd wallpaper-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
